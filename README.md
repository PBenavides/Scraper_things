# Scraper_things
This is a repository where I prove different scraping methods.

The objective will be to use different tools and identify the differences between those. All in Python language and maybe will be one in R or js (if it is necessary). 

The libraries that I will be using all in different projects: 

- Scrapy
- Requests & BeautifulSoup
- Selenium
- rvest (R) -- Not confirmed
